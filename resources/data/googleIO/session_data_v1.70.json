This talk will show you how to set this up in your own apps, and will demo several scenarios with popular apps that â€œjust workâ€ out of the box after a restore.

Virtual reality introduces a new set of physiological and ergonomic considerations to your design work. Additionally, as a new medium users may not have established a familiarity with interacting with virtual reality applications yet. And with an infinite canvas inside of your application, there are some very real challenges with guiding the userâ€™s focus and attention. Weâ€™ll review common interactive patterns for virtual reality applications that work well. We'll also discuss best practices for rapid prototyping in virtual reality, and what the Google VR design team has learned from crafting virtual reality applications.

But that might be a bit more difficult than you think. In this talk,we will take a look at what â€œrendering performanceâ€ means, alongside some of the most common pitfalls that are ran into; and letâ€™s not forget the important stuff: the tools that help you track down, and fix these issues before they become large problems.

      "description": "See how you can improve your appâ€™s ratings by testing early, broader and often. With nearly unlimited resources of the cloud and significant automation, this is achievable for even the most constrained app development teams. \nWant to access the latest (and old) Android and iOS devices that your app might need to run on? Wish you could run hundreds of tests in parallel on every combination for every commit? Want to improve quality without even writing tests? Join us to see how all three can be achieved. We will use a Google Cloud test service to illustrate some of the key practices that you can incorporate in your app development. (Note: This Sandbox talk will be offered twice throughout the event. Check the schedule to confirm timings.)",

The Android â€œMâ€ release ships with full data cloud backup in Google Drive, so now all of the user data associated with an app (â€œAppDataâ€) will be backed up and restored. This talk will show you how to set this up in your own apps, and will demo several scenarios with popular apps that â€œjust workâ€ out of the box after a restore. This seamless full-data backup creates an awesome user experience and maximizes user adoption of your apps even when transitioning to a new device.

With the shift to mobile, there is an increasing need to fight spam in that space. However, traditional CAPTCHAs are not well suited for mobile form factors. In response, the reCAPTCHA team recently launched a completely reimagined API that lets users pass the CAPTCHA test with just a single click. This â€œNo CAPTCHA reCAPTCHAâ€ dramatically simplifies the mobile user experience. In this talk we will discuss the technology behind the magic â€œNo CAPTCHAâ€ followed by an interactive codelab to implement reCAPTCHA on your mobile site.

The system will track what youâ€™re doing, and will free an object on your behalf when it isnâ€™t needed any more. While this is great for your general health, and blood pressure, this doesnâ€™t exclude performance problems from happening here. In this talk, we will walk through how the Android memory system works, and identify some common perf problems, and introduce you to tools to help track down and solve the issues.

With the shift to mobile, there is an increasing need to fight spam in that space. However, traditional CAPTCHAs are not well suited for mobile form factors. In response, the reCAPTCHA team recently launched a completely reimagined API that lets users pass the CAPTCHA test with just a single click. This â€œNo CAPTCHA reCAPTCHAâ€ dramatically simplifies the mobile user experience. In this talk we will discuss the technology behind the magic â€œNo CAPTCHAâ€ followed by an interactive codelab to implement reCAPTCHA on your mobile site.
