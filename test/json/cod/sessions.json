  "description": "Eclipse is an open source project which reflects the work of its community. At their respective level, anyone can contribute without necessarily having to be an advanced developer.\nFollowing an introduction of the different types of contributions and the role that anyone can have, this talk will then focus more specifically on the code contribution.\nWe will explain the standard use cases and then we will show you how to fix some bugs in live and how to use git and gerrit in this purpose.\nFor this talk we will focus on some E4 tools or platform-ui bugs that could be easily fixed.\nIf you also plan to attend the hackathon session, and if you have no idea on how to fix bugs, this talk will be a very good introduction to learn the basics.
